# DangerRun-SpiritBox
Virtual Spirit Box App created as an add on to a haunt magazine rollout by Danger Run LLC. This is amy second app for this company. The app works by the user typing in a phrase and submitting that phrase with hopes of hearing a ghost speak a clue or directions. 

Audio is all placeholder but will be completed once the VO is completed. All coding and Artwork done by myself.
